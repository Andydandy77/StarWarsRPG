# StarWarsRPG

Welcome to Coruscant, where the aristocracy live in their tall skyscrapers and the lowly pleibians dwell in the depths of the sprawling city's streets. In this game, you must first click a character to choose as your champion. Choose wisely! Each character's attack, counter attack, hp are randomized based on the character. Use your intuition to determine the character with the best stats. 

Once you choose a champion, choose your first opponenent by clicking on him. After that, you and your opponents stats will be calculated and then the fight begins!

Click the attack button to deal damage to your opponent's hp. You deal damage equal to your attack power and your opponent deals damage to you equal to their counter attack power. After each attack, your attack will increment based on your chosen character. If your hp falls to 0, you lose the game and you can restart if you'd like. If you overcome your opponent, you must click on a new opponent to begin the next battle.

You win once you defeat all available opponents. 

### Good luck and let the Force be with you!
